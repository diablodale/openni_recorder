A recorder of OpenNI data; uses a XML configuration file
for the majority of its configuration

Initially written and tested using:
- Windows 7 64-bit Service Pack 1
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Version 10.0.30319.1 RTMRel
- Hotfix for Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express - ENU (KB2455033)   KB2455033
- OpenNI 1.1.0.39 for Win32
- PrimeSense NITE 1.3.1.4 for Win32
- PrimeSense Sensor KinectMod 5.0.1.32 for Win32
- Max/MSP/Jitter 5.1.8 for Windows


Usage:
   record.exe secondsToRecord [xmlconfigfilename]

Where:
   - secondsToRecord is the number of seconds for this
     program to run, therefore record

   - xmlconfigfilename is the path to the XML config file,
     if no value is given then it defaults to ./recorder_config.xml

Note:
   An XML config file (defaults to recorder_config.xml) is essential
   for this program's operation. Its format is defined in OpenNI_UserGuide.pdf
   which is provided in the OpenNI SDK. Look for sections on XML as a
   configuration script.

Versions:
1.0.0	Initial release with full functionality
